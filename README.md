Game engine in C++ 

A project I wanted to make to show my skills and to see for myself what my skills can do. 

So here it is, this is my very own game engine built from nothing. I don't know how far it will go, but I do know I want it to grow and flower. 

I have some plans for what I want to do, such as add support for different graphics APIs such as OpenGL, DirectX 11, DirectX 12 and possibly Vulkan. I want to add support for networking, so it is easy to use and maybe take up a couple more lines of code for it to be added to a game.
